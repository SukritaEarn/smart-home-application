# Overview

In this project, we propose a new system architecture IoT based smart home that can practically function close to a common one that is available in the market. Besides, this system can also act as a global application that supports the ESP chipset based device to be able to be controlled and monitored via the web application interfaces solely by using laptops or smartphones anywhere and anytime.
